// Built-in constructors, also known as native constructors, are standard constructors provided by JavaScript that allow you to create objects of various data types. These constructors are available globally and do not need to be explicitly defined. They provide a convenient way to create instances of primitive data types and built-in objects.

// --> Num Constructor
let num1 = new Number(1)
// --> Str constructor
let str1 = new String("Nati")
// --> Boolean Constructor
let bool1 = new Boolean(true)
// --> arry Constructor
let ary1 = new Array(1, 2, 3)
console.log(ary1)
